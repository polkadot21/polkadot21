# Nice to meet you here, sir or madam

I am a senior python dev/machine learning eng. That's probably the most important thing you must know if you're skimming through my Github. On top of this, I am a huge advocate of open-source who scarcely develops open-source projects, a data scientist who hates writing code in Jupyter notebooks (but not for visualization), and a hater of Python programming language because of GIL, recursive tail optimization, and whitespaces who internally really loves writing code in Python.

## In my free time...

In my free time, I usually do some external projects, mostly unicorn start-ups that go insolvent before making me wealthy.


## I'd like to learn...

I am currently learning solidity. If you have some trustworthy sources, please, let me know.

## I'm interested in...
I am keen on doing sports, namely, swimming and freediving.
